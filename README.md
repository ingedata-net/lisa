LIdar Segmentation and Annotation File Format

## Purpose

`lisa` is a file format which store LIDAR data to use in annotation workflow.
As currently there is no standard format and PLY, PCD or ROSbag files are used;
theses files contains a lot of informations unnecessary for annotate and segment
LIDAR frames.

In Ingedata, we are commited to provide the fastest production platform for
LIDAR annotation, and to do that we needed to store the informations coming from
our clients in a format which is contained in terms of size and easy to share
across the stakeholders.
